      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const players2 = players.slice();

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const players3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const players4 = [...players];

      console.log("Before modification");
      console.table({ players, players2, players3, players4 });

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      players2.push("B");
      players3.push("C");
      players4.push("D");

      console.log("After modification");
      console.table({ players, players2, players3, players4 });

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });

      console.table({ person, person2 });

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      //   const person3 = {...person };

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
